# AI Search Optimization (AEO & GEO)

> **Scope:** Optimizing content for AI-powered search engines and answer engines
> This skill covers strategies for visibility in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Microsoft Copilot, and other generative AI platforms.

## 1. Understanding AEO & GEO

### What is AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)?

Answer Engine Optimization focuses on structuring content to provide **direct, concise answers** to user queries through AI-powered platforms. Unlike traditional SEO which aims for link clicks, AEO optimizes for being **cited as the answer source**.

**Target platforms:**
- Google AI Overviews (formerly SGE)
- Perplexity AI
- ChatGPT Search
- Microsoft Copilot Search
- Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)

### What is GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)?

Generative Engine Optimization is the broader discipline of enhancing content visibility within **AI-generated search results**. It targets generative engines that synthesize answers from multiple sources rather than presenting traditional link lists.

**Key differences from traditional SEO:**

| Aspect | Traditional SEO | AEO/GEO |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Goal | Rank in SERPs | Be cited in AI answers |
| User behavior | Click through to site | Get answer directly |
| Content format | Keyword-optimized pages | Structured, citable content |
| Success metric | Click-through rate | Citation frequency |
| Query type | Short keywords | Conversational, long-tail |

### The AI Search Landscape (2025-2026)

- **Google AI Overviews:** 2B+ monthly users across 200 countries ([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/googles-ai-overviews-have-2b-monthly-users-ai-mode-100m-in-the-us-and-india/))
- **Google AI Mode:** 100M+ monthly users in US and India
- **ChatGPT Search:** Real-time web search with citations
- **Perplexity AI:** Real-time citation engine, emphasis on freshness
- **Microsoft Copilot Search:** Bing integration with generative AI
- **Zero-click searches:** About 60% of global searches end without a click ([neotype.ai](https://neotype.ai/zeroclick-searches/))

## 2. Content Structure for AI Readability

### Semantic HTML Structure

AI systems extract information more effectively from well-structured content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Descriptive, Question-Answering Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <article>
        <header>
            <h1>Primary Topic as Question or Clear Statement</h1>
            <p class="summary">Direct 2-3 sentence answer to the main question.</p>
        </header>
        
        <main>
            <section>
                <h2>Subtopic Heading</h2>
                <p>Detailed explanation with facts and data.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Key point 1 with specific information</li>
                    <li>Key point 2 with verifiable data</li>
                    <li>Key point 3 with actionable insight</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
        </main>
        
        <aside>
            <h3>Quick Facts</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt>Term</dt>
                <dd>Definition</dd>
            </dl>
        </aside>
    </article>
</body>
</html>
```

### Heading Hierarchy Best Practices

```markdown
# H1: Main Topic (contains primary question/keyword)
   └── ## H2: Major subtopic
          └── ### H3: Specific aspect
                 └── #### H4: Details (use sparingly)
```

**Rules:**
- Single H1 per page
- H1 should answer "What is this page about?"
- Use question-format headings when appropriate
- Include target keywords naturally

### The Inverted Pyramid Pattern

Structure content for AI extraction:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│     DIRECT ANSWER (First 1-2       │ ← AI extracts this
│     sentences answer the query)     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│     KEY FACTS & CONTEXT            │ ← Supporting evidence
│     (Bullet points, data, quotes)   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│     DETAILED EXPLANATION           │ ← Comprehensive coverage
│     (Background, methodology,       │
│      examples, case studies)        │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│     RELATED TOPICS                 │ ← Topic authority signals
│     (Links to related content)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Lists and Tables for Extraction

AI engines prefer structured data formats:

```html
<!-- Comparison Table -->
<table>
    <caption>Feature Comparison: Product A vs Product B</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Feature</th>
            <th>Product A</th>
            <th>Product B</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Price</td>
            <td>$99/month</td>
            <td>$149/month</td>
        </tr>
        <!-- More rows -->
    </tbody>
</table>

<!-- Definition List for Terms -->
<dl>
    <dt>AEO</dt>
    <dd>Answer Engine Optimization - optimizing content for direct answers</dd>
    
    <dt>GEO</dt>
    <dd>Generative Engine Optimization - visibility in AI-generated results</dd>
</dl>

<!-- Step-by-Step Process -->
<ol>
    <li>Step one with clear action</li>
    <li>Step two with measurable outcome</li>
    <li>Step three with verification method</li>
</ol>
```

## 3. Schema Markup for AI Understanding

### Essential Schema Types

Research shows structured data significantly improves AI search visibility:

- Pages with schema are **up to 40% more likely** to appear in Google AI Overviews ([zarkx.com](https://www.zarkx.com/insights/ai-first-schema-implementation-rich-results))
- **Organization schema**: 2.8x increase in citation frequency
- **FAQPage schema**: 2.5x rise in answer inclusion
- **Article schema**: 2.2x boost in content citations
- Sites with 15+ schema types see **2.4x higher citation rates** ([surgeboom.com](https://surgeboom.com/research/structured-data-ai-citation-impact-study.html))

            </time>
            <time datetime="2025-01-15" itemprop="dateModified">
                Last Updated: January 15, 2025
            </time>
        </div>
    </header>
    <!-- Content -->
</article>
```

## 6. Robots.txt for AI Crawlers

### Allowing AI Bots

To be indexed by AI search engines, explicitly allow their crawlers:

```text
# robots.txt - AI Search Optimization

# Standard search engines
User-agent: Googlebot
Allow: /

User-agent: Bingbot
Allow: /

# OpenAI (ChatGPT)
User-agent: GPTBot
Allow: /

User-agent: ChatGPT-User
Allow: /

# Perplexity AI
User-agent: PerplexityBot
Allow: /

# Anthropic (Claude)
User-agent: ClaudeBot
Allow: /
User-agent: anthropic-ai
Allow: /

# Google AI (Gemini)
User-agent: Google-Extended
Allow: /

# Meta AI
User-agent: FacebookBot
Allow: /

# Common Crawl (used by many AI systems)
User-agent: CCBot
Allow: /

# Microsoft/Bing AI
User-agent: Applebot
Allow: /

# Default rule
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /private/

# Sitemap
Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemap.xml
```

### Blocking AI Training While Allowing AI Search (Optional)

Some organizations want to be **cited in AI search results** but don't want their content **used to train AI models**. Here's how:

**Understanding the difference:**

| Bot | What it does | Block = |
|-----|--------------|---------|
| `GPTBot` | Crawls for **training** OpenAI models | Your content won't train future GPT versions |
| `ChatGPT-User` | **Live browsing** when users search | ChatGPT can't cite you in real-time answers |
| `Google-Extended` | Crawls for **training** Gemini AI | Your content won't train Gemini |
| `PerplexityBot` | **Live search** for Perplexity answers | Perplexity can't cite you |
| `CCBot` | Common Crawl - open **training datasets** | Your content won't be in public AI training data |

**Example: Block training, allow live search citations:**

```text
# BLOCK: AI model training (your content won't train future AI)
User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow: /

User-agent: Google-Extended
Disallow: /

User-agent: CCBot
Disallow: /

# ALLOW: Real-time AI search (AI can cite you in answers)
User-agent: ChatGPT-User
Allow: /

User-agent: PerplexityBot
Allow: /
```

> **Note:** Most businesses focused on AI search visibility should **allow all bots** (Section 6 above).
> Only use this approach if you have specific concerns about AI training on your content.

### AI Bot Reference

| Bot Name | Company | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| GPTBot | OpenAI | Training data & ChatGPT browsing |
| ChatGPT-User | OpenAI | ChatGPT web browsing |
| PerplexityBot | Perplexity | Real-time search & citations |
| ClaudeBot | Anthropic | Training & retrieval |
| anthropic-ai | Anthropic | Claude AI training |
| Google-Extended | Google | Gemini AI training |
| FacebookBot | Meta | Meta AI training |
| CCBot | Common Crawl | Open dataset for AI training |

## 7. Conversational Query Optimization

### Target Long-Tail, Question-Based Queries

AI search favors natural language:

**Traditional keyword:** `"best project management software"`

**Conversational queries:**
- "What is the best project management software for small teams?"
- "How do I choose project management software for remote work?"
- "Which project management tool has the best free plan?"

### Question-Answer Content Pattern

```markdown
## What is [Topic]?

[Topic] is [direct definition in 1-2 sentences].

### Key characteristics:
- Characteristic 1
- Characteristic 2
- Characteristic 3

## How does [Topic] work?

[Clear explanation of process]

### Step-by-step breakdown:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Why is [Topic] important?

[2-3 sentences on significance]

### Benefits include:
- Benefit 1 with specific outcome
- Benefit 2 with measurable result
- Benefit 3 with real-world application
```

### FAQ Section Template

```html
<section class="faq">
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <details>
        <summary>What is Answer Engine Optimization?</summary>
        <p>Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the practice of...</p>
    </details>

        <summary>Which AI search platforms should I optimize for?</summary>
        <p>The main platforms to consider are...</p>
    </details>
</section>
```

## 8. Multimedia Optimization

### Image Requirements

Perplexity and other AI engines prefer visual content:

```html
<figure>
    <img 
        src="/images/ai-search-diagram.webp" 
        alt="Diagram showing how AI search engines process and cite content"
        width="800"
        height="450"
        loading="lazy"
    />
    <figcaption>
        How AI search engines extract and cite content sources
    </figcaption>
</figure>
```

**Best practices:**
- Minimum 2 unique, relevant images per article
- Descriptive alt text (not keyword stuffing)
- WebP format for performance
- Include diagrams, infographics, process flows
- Add captions with context

### Video Integration

```html
<figure class="video-embed">
    <iframe 
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID"
        title="Detailed explanation of AI Search Optimization"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media"
        allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
    <figcaption>
        Video: Complete guide to optimizing for AI search engines
    </figcaption>

## 13. TYPO3 Implementation Guide

> **Compatibility:** TYPO3 v13.x and v14.x (v14 preferred)
> All configurations in this section work on both v13 and v14.

This section covers TYPO3-specific implementation of AEO/GEO strategies using TYPO3 extensions, configuration, and best practices.

### Installation Mode: Composer vs Classic

> **⚠️ Composer Mode Highly Recommended**
>
> For AI search optimization, **Composer-based TYPO3 installations are strongly recommended**.
> All extensions in this guide are available via both Composer (Packagist) and TER (Classic Mode).

#### Why Composer Mode is Essential for Modern TYPO3

| Aspect | Composer Mode | Classic Mode |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Dependency Resolution** | Automatic with version constraints | Manual, no transitive dependencies |
| **Autoloading** | PSR-4 optimized, production-ready | TYPO3 internal, less optimized |
| **Security** | Separate web root (`/public`) | All files in web root |
| **Updates** | Single command: `composer update` | Manual download/upload per extension |
| **Reproducibility** | `composer.lock` ensures identical installs | No version locking mechanism |
| **TYPO3 v14 Future** | Fully supported | Requires `composer.json` in all extensions |

#### Technical Explanation

**Composer Mode** uses PHP's standard dependency manager to:

1. **Resolve Dependencies Automatically**: Extensions like `brotkrueml/schema` depend on `psr/http-message` and other packages. Composer resolves the entire dependency tree, ensuring compatible versions are installed.

2. **Generate Optimized Autoloaders**: Composer creates a PSR-4 compliant autoloader that loads classes on-demand, improving performance compared to TYPO3's legacy class loading.

3. **Enforce Version Constraints**: The `composer.json` constraint `"typo3/cms-core": "^13.4 || ^14.0"` guarantees only compatible versions are installed.

4. **Enable Security Isolation**: The recommended structure places `vendor/`, `config/`, and other sensitive directories outside the web-accessible `/public` folder.

5. **Support Modern Workflows**: CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and deployment tools expect Composer-based projects.

**TYPO3 v14 Breaking Change**: In TYPO3 v14, even Classic Mode requires every extension to have a valid `composer.json` with proper `type` and `extension-key` definitions. Extensions without this file will not be detected.

```json
// Required composer.json structure for all extensions (v14+)
{
    "name": "vendor/extension-key",
    "type": "typo3-cms-extension",
    "extra": {
        "typo3/cms": {
            "extension-key": "extension_key"
        }
    }
}
```

### Extension Compatibility Matrix

| Extension | TYPO3 v13 | TYPO3 v14 | PHP | Composer | TER | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----|----------|-----|---------|
| `typo3/cms-seo` | ✓ | ✓ | 8.2+ | ✓ | ✓ | Core SEO (meta tags, sitemaps, canonicals) |
| `brotkrueml/schema` | ✓ (v4.x) | ✓ (v4.x) | 8.2+ | ✓ | ✓ | Schema.org structured data (JSON-LD) |
| `yoast-seo-for-typo3/yoast_seo` | ✓ | ✗ | 8.1+ | ✓ | ✓ | Content analysis, readability (v13 only) |
| `clickstorm/cs_seo` | ✓ (v9.3+) | ✓ (v9.3+) | 8.2+ | ✓ | ✓ | Extended SEO features, evaluations |

### 13.1 Required Extensions Installation

#### Composer Mode (Recommended)

```bash
# Core SEO extension (meta tags, sitemaps, canonicals)
ddev composer require typo3/cms-seo

# Schema.org structured data (essential for AI search)
# Version constraint ensures v13/v14 compatibility
ddev composer require brotkrueml/schema:"^4.2"

# Optional: Extended SEO features (v13/v14 compatible)
ddev composer require clickstorm/cs_seo:"^9.3"

# In Composer mode, extensions are auto-activated
# Verify installation:
ddev typo3 extension:list | grep -E "seo|schema"
```

**Version Constraints Explained:**

```json
{
    "require": {
        "typo3/cms-seo": "^13.4 || ^14.0",
        "brotkrueml/schema": "^4.2"
    }
}
```

- `^4.2` = Any version ≥4.2.0 and <5.0.0 (allows minor/patch updates)
- `^13.4 || ^14.0` = Supports both TYPO3 v13.4+ and v14.0+

#### Classic Mode (TER)

> **Note:** Classic Mode is supported but not recommended. TYPO3 v14 requires
> all extensions to have a valid `composer.json` even in Classic Mode.

1. **Download from TER:**
   - https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/seo
   - https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/schema

2. **Install via Extension Manager:**
   - Backend → Admin Tools → Extensions
   - Click "Upload Extension" or use "Get Extensions" to search TER
   - Activate each extension after upload

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Check Admin Tools → Extensions for active status
   - Clear all caches after activation

### 13.2 Robots.txt Configuration for AI Bots

Configure robots.txt via TYPO3's static routes to allow AI crawlers:

```yaml
# config/sites/main/config.yaml
routes:
  - route: robots.txt
    type: staticText
    content: |
      # Standard search engines
      User-agent: Googlebot
      Allow: /
      
      User-agent: Bingbot
      Allow: /
      
      # OpenAI (ChatGPT)
      User-agent: GPTBot
      Allow: /
      
      User-agent: ChatGPT-User
      Allow: /
      
      # Perplexity AI
      User-agent: PerplexityBot
      Allow: /
      
      # Anthropic (Claude)
      User-agent: ClaudeBot
      Allow: /
      
      User-agent: anthropic-ai
      Allow: /
      
      # Google AI (Gemini)
      User-agent: Google-Extended
      Allow: /
      
      # Meta AI
      User-agent: FacebookBot
      Allow: /
      
      # Common Crawl (used by many AI systems)
      User-agent: CCBot
      Allow: /
      
      # Default
      User-agent: *
      Allow: /
      Disallow: /typo3/
      Disallow: /typo3conf/
      Disallow: /typo3temp/
      
      Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemap.xml
```

  data: Record<string, unknown>;
};

export function JsonLd({ data }: JsonLdProps) {
  return (
    <script
      type="application/ld+json"
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
        __html: JSON.stringify(data).replace(/</g, '\\u003c'),
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

```mdx

#### Astro with astro-seo-schema

```bash
npm install schema-dts astro-seo-schema
```

```astro
---
// src/layouts/Article.astro
import { Schema } from 'astro-seo-schema';
const { frontmatter } = Astro.props;
---
<html>
<head>
  <Schema item={{
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "Article",
    "headline": frontmatter.title,
    "description": frontmatter.description,
    "author": {
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": frontmatter.author.name
    },
    "datePublished": frontmatter.date,
    "dateModified": frontmatter.lastmod
  }} />
</head>
<body>
  <slot />
</body>
</html>
```

### 14.4 FAQ Schema Component for MDX

```tsx
// components/FAQ.tsx
import { JsonLd } from './JsonLd';

type FAQItem = {
  question: string;
  answer: string;
};

type FAQProps = {
  items: FAQItem[];
};

export function FAQ({ items }: FAQProps) {
  const schemaData = {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "FAQPage",
    "mainEntity": items.map(item => ({
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": item.question,
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": item.answer
      }
    }))
  };

  return (
    <>
      <JsonLd data={schemaData} />
      <section className="faq">
        {items.map((item, index) => (
          <details key={index}>
            <summary>{item.question}</summary>
            <p>{item.answer}</p>
          </details>
        ))}
      </section>
    </>
  );
}
```

```mdx
import { FAQ } from '@/components/FAQ';

## Frequently Asked Questions

<FAQ items={[
  {
    question: "What is AEO?",
    answer: "Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the practice of optimizing content to be cited directly in AI-generated answers."
  },
  {
    question: "How is GEO different from SEO?",
    answer: "GEO targets AI-generated search results, while traditional SEO focuses on ranking in link-based search results."
  }
]} />
```

### 14.5 Raw MDX View with URL Parameter

Enable viewing raw MDX source for transparency and AI training accessibility:

#### Next.js Implementation

```typescript
// next.config.js - Rewrite .md URLs to API
module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/docs/:path*.md',
        destination: '/api/raw-mdx?path=:path*',
      },
    ];
  },
};
```

```typescript
// app/api/raw-mdx/route.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const searchParams = request.nextUrl.searchParams;
  const filePath = searchParams.get('path');
  
  if (!filePath) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Path required' }, { status: 400 });
  }
  
  // Prevent directory traversal
  const safePath = filePath.replace(/\.\./g, '');
  const mdxPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'content', `${safePath}.mdx`);
  
  try {
    const content = fs.readFileSync(mdxPath, 'utf8');
    return new NextResponse(content, {
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain; charset=utf-8' },
    });
  } catch {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Not found' }, { status: 404 });
  }
}
```

**Usage:**
- `/docs/getting-started` → Rendered page
- `/docs/getting-started.md` → Raw MDX source

#### Query Parameter Alternative

```typescript
// app/docs/[...slug]/page.tsx
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

type Props = {
  params: { slug: string[] };
  searchParams: { raw?: string };
};

export default async function Page({ params, searchParams }: Props) {
  const slug = params.slug.join('/');
  const mdxPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'content', `${slug}.mdx`);
  
  // Show raw MDX if ?raw=true
  if (searchParams.raw === 'true') {
    try {
      const rawContent = fs.readFileSync(mdxPath, 'utf8');
      return (
        <article>
          <header>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">
              Raw MDX source • <a href={`/docs/${slug}`}>View rendered</a>
            </p>
          </header>
          <pre className="p-4 bg-gray-50 rounded overflow-auto">
            <code>{rawContent}</code>
          </pre>
        </article>
      );
    } catch {
      notFound();
    }
  }
  
  // Normal MDX rendering
  // ... your MDX processing
}
```

**Usage:**
- `/docs/getting-started` → Rendered page
- `/docs/getting-started?raw=true` → Raw MDX source

### 14.6 Automatic Schema Generation from Frontmatter

```typescript
// lib/generateSchema.ts
type Frontmatter = {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  date: string;
  lastmod?: string;
  author?: {
    name: string;
    title?: string;
    linkedin?: string;
    twitter?: string;
  };
  image?: string;
  schema?: {
    type?: 'Article' | 'HowTo' | 'FAQPage';
    wordCount?: number;
  };
};

export function generateSchema(frontmatter: Frontmatter, url: string) {
  const schemaType = frontmatter.schema?.type || 'Article';
  
  const baseSchema = {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": schemaType,
    "headline": frontmatter.title,
    "description": frontmatter.description,
    "url": url,
    "datePublished": frontmatter.date,
    "dateModified": frontmatter.lastmod || frontmatter.date,
  };
  
  if (frontmatter.author) {
    const sameAs = [
      frontmatter.author.linkedin,
      frontmatter.author.twitter,
    ].filter(Boolean);
    
    baseSchema["author"] = {
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": frontmatter.author.name,
      "jobTitle": frontmatter.author.title,
      ...(sameAs.length > 0 && { "sameAs": sameAs }),
    };
  }
  
  if (frontmatter.image) {
    baseSchema["image"] = frontmatter.image;
  }
  
  if (frontmatter.schema?.wordCount) {
    baseSchema["wordCount"] = frontmatter.schema.wordCount;
  }
  
  return baseSchema;
}
```

### 14.7 MD/MDX AI Search Checklist

- [ ] **Frontmatter:** Title, description, date, lastmod, author with credentials
- [ ] **Structure:** Single H1, logical heading hierarchy, direct answers first
- [ ] **Schema:** JSON-LD in layout or per-page (Article, FAQPage, HowTo)
- [ ] **FAQ sections:** Use `<details>/<summary>` with FAQPage schema
- [ ] **Tables:** For comparisons (AI extracts structured data)
- [ ] **Lists:** Bullet points and numbered steps
- [ ] **Last modified:** Visible and in frontmatter
- [ ] **Author bio:** Name, credentials, social links
- [ ] **Raw view:** Optional `.md` or `?raw=true` endpoint
- [ ] **Images:** Alt text, proper dimensions, WebP format
- [ ] **llms.txt:** LLM-friendly site index (see Section 15)

---

## 15. llms.txt - LLM Site Index

The `llms.txt` standard provides a structured, machine-readable file to help LLMs understand and navigate your website content efficiently.

> **Note:** As of late 2025, adoption by major AI companies is still limited, but implementing
> llms.txt is low-effort and future-proofs your site for AI discovery.

### 15.1 What is llms.txt?

Similar to `robots.txt` for crawlers, `llms.txt` is a Markdown file at your site root that:

- Provides a **concise index** of key documentation/pages
- Includes **descriptions** to help LLMs understand content purpose
- Enables AI tools to **find relevant content** without parsing your entire site
- Supports an optional **llms-full.txt** with complete documentation

### 15.2 Basic llms.txt Format

```markdown
# Your Company Name

> Brief one-sentence description of your site/product.

Additional context about the site, target audience, and how to use this index.

## Documentation

- [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started): Quick introduction for new users
- [API Reference](/docs/api): Complete API documentation with examples
- [Configuration Guide](/docs/configuration): Setup and configuration options

## Tutorials

- [Building Your First App](/tutorials/first-app): Step-by-step beginner guide
- [Advanced Patterns](/tutorials/advanced): In-depth exploration of features

## Optional

- [About Us](/about): Company background and team
- [Blog](/blog): Latest news and articles
- [Changelog](/changelog): Version history and updates
```

**Key rules:**
- Single H1 (`#`) with site/project name
- Blockquote (`>`) with brief description
- H2 sections (`##`) for content groups
- Links formatted as `[Title](URL): Description`
- `## Optional` section for content LLMs can skip

### 15.3 llms-full.txt - Complete Documentation

For sites with extensive documentation, provide a `llms-full.txt` containing your entire documentation in a single Markdown file:

```markdown
# Your Company Documentation

> Complete documentation for Your Company's platform.

---

## Getting Started

[Full content of getting started page...]

---

## API Reference

### Authentication

[Full API auth documentation...]

### Endpoints

[Full API endpoints documentation...]

---

## Configuration

[Full configuration documentation...]
```

**Use cases:**
- AI coding assistants need full API context
- Complex integrations require complete documentation
- Technical support AI needs comprehensive knowledge base

### 15.4 TYPO3 Implementation

TYPO3 has a dedicated extension for llms.txt generation:

```bash
# Install the extension (TYPO3 v13+)
ddev composer require web-vision/ai-llms-txt
```

#### Site Configuration

```yaml
# config/sites/main/config.yaml
imports:
  - resource: 'EXT:ai_llms_txt/Configuration/Routes/RouterEnhancer.yaml'
```

#### TypoScript Configuration

```typoscript
# Include extension TypoScript
@import 'EXT:ai_llms_txt/Configuration/TypoScript/setup.typoscript'

# Custom configuration
plugin.tx_aillmstxt {
    settings {
        # Pages to include (comma-separated UIDs or "auto")
        includePages = auto
        
        # Exclude specific pages
        excludePages = 1,2,3
        
        # Include page types
        includeDoktypes = 1,4
        
        # Maximum depth
        maxDepth = 3
    }
}
```

#### Manual llms.txt via Static Route

For full control, create a static route:

```yaml
# config/sites/main/config.yaml
routes:
  - route: llms.txt
    type: staticText
    content: |
      # Your TYPO3 Site
      
      > Enterprise content management and digital experience platform.
      
      ## Main Sections
      
      - [Home](https://example.com/): Main landing page
      - [Products](https://example.com/products): Our product catalog
      - [Documentation](https://example.com/docs): Technical documentation
      - [Blog](https://example.com/blog): Latest articles and news
      
      ## Optional
      
      - [About Us](https://example.com/about): Company information
      - [Contact](https://example.com/contact): Get in touch
```

### 15.5 Next.js Implementation

#### Static File (Simple)

```markdown
<!-- public/llms.txt -->
# Your Next.js App

> Modern web application built with Next.js.

## Pages

- [Home](/): Main landing page
- [Documentation](/docs): Technical docs
- [Blog](/blog): Latest articles
```

#### Dynamic Generation (App Router)

```typescript
// app/llms.txt/route.ts
import { getDocPages, getBlogPosts } from '@/lib/content';

export async function GET() {
  const docs = await getDocPages();
  const posts = await getBlogPosts();
  
  const content = `# Your Site Name

> Brief description of your site.

## Documentation

${docs.map(doc => `- [${doc.title}](/docs/${doc.slug}): ${doc.description}`).join('\n')}

## Blog

${posts.slice(0, 10).map(post => `- [${post.title}](/blog/${post.slug}): ${post.excerpt}`).join('\n')}

## Optional

- [About](/about): About us
- [Contact](/contact): Get in touch
`;

  return new Response(content, {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'text/plain; charset=utf-8',
      'Cache-Control': 'public, max-age=3600, must-revalidate',
    },
  });
}
```

#### llms-full.txt Generation

```typescript
// app/llms-full.txt/route.ts
import { getDocPages } from '@/lib/content';
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';

export async function GET() {
  const docs = await getDocPages();
  
  let fullContent = `# Complete Documentation

> Full documentation for Your Site.

`;

  for (const doc of docs) {
    const mdxPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'content/docs', `${doc.slug}.mdx`);
    try {
      const content = fs.readFileSync(mdxPath, 'utf8');
      // Remove frontmatter
      const cleanContent = content.replace(/^---[\s\S]*?---\n/, '');
      fullContent += `---\n\n## ${doc.title}\n\n${cleanContent}\n\n`;
    } catch {
      // Skip if file not found
    }
  }

  return new Response(fullContent, {
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'text/plain; charset=utf-8',
      'Cache-Control': 'public, max-age=3600, must-revalidate',
    },
  });
}
```

### 15.6 Astro Implementation

#### Using Integration

```bash
npm install @waldheimdev/astro-ai-llms-txt
```

```javascript
// astro.config.mjs
import llmsTxt from '@waldheimdev/astro-ai-llms-txt';

export default {
  integrations: [
    llmsTxt({
      projectName: 'Your Project',
      description: 'Your project description.',
      site: 'https://your-domain.com',
    }),
  ],
};
```

#### Manual API Route

```typescript
// src/pages/llms.txt.ts
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
import type { APIRoute } from 'astro';

export const GET: APIRoute = async () => {
  const docs = await getCollection('docs');
  const blog = await getCollection('blog');
  
  const content = `# Your Astro Site

> Static site built with Astro.

## Documentation

${docs.map(doc => `- [${doc.data.title}](/docs/${doc.slug}): ${doc.data.description}`).join('\n')}

## Blog

${blog.slice(0, 10).map(post => `- [${post.data.title}](/blog/${post.slug}): ${post.data.excerpt}`).join('\n')}
`;

  return new Response(content, {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain; charset=utf-8' },
  });
};
```

### 15.7 llms.txt Best Practices

| Aspect | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| **File size** | Keep under 50KB for efficient parsing |
| **Descriptions** | Brief, informative (not marketing copy) |
| **Links** | Use absolute URLs for external consumption |
| **Updates** | Regenerate on content changes |
| **Sections** | Group logically (Docs, API, Tutorials, Optional) |
| **Optional section** | Mark non-essential content LLMs can skip |

### 15.8 llms.txt Checklist

- [ ] **llms.txt** at site root with structured index
- [ ] **H1 heading** with site/project name
- [ ] **Blockquote summary** describing the site
- [ ] **Organized sections** (Docs, API, Blog, Optional)
- [ ] **Link descriptions** for each URL
- [ ] **llms-full.txt** for documentation-heavy sites (optional)
- [ ] **Cache headers** set appropriately (1 hour recommended)
- [ ] **UTF-8 encoding** with text/plain content type
