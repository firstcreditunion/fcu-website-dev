# First Credit Union Website - Core Standards

## Project Context
A complete website rebuild for First Credit Union, Hamilton NZ. This is a financial services website requiring high security, accessibility compliance, and professional presentation.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 16 (App Router, Server Components, Server Actions)
- React 19.2 (Server Components, use() hook, Actions)
- TypeScript 5.x (strict mode enabled)
- Tailwind CSS v4 (new @theme directive, CSS-first config)
- Framer Motion (animations, page transitions)
- Supabase Pro (PostgreSQL, Auth, Edge Functions, Storage)
- Sanity CMS v3 (content management, GROQ queries)
- Vercel Pro (deployment, ISR, Edge Functions, Analytics)

## UI Component Libraries (Priority Order)
1. Shadcn/ui - Primary components (https://ui.shadcn.com/)
2. Magic UI - Animated effects (https://magicui.design/)
3. React Bits - Additional components (https://www.reactbits.dev/)

## Critical Requirements
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance (mandatory)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Core Web Vitals optimization (LCP, FID, CLS)
- SEO with financial services schema markup
- PCI-DSS awareness for any form handling

## Code Standards
- TypeScript strict mode - no `any` without documented justification
- Prefer Server Components; use 'use client' only when necessary
- Named exports over default exports (except page.tsx, layout.tsx)
- Functions under 50 lines; extract helpers when larger
- Meaningful variable names reflecting financial domain

## File Naming
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `LoanCalculator.tsx`)
- Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `formatInterestRate.ts`)
- API routes: kebab-case (e.g., `loan-application/route.ts`)
- Sanity schemas: camelCase (e.g., `loanProduct.ts`)

## Before Writing Code
1. Confirm understanding of requirements
2. Check existing patterns in codebase first
3. Consider accessibility implications
4. Plan error states and loading states
5. Don't auto-agree - challenge approach if better options exist

## NZ Financial Context
- Use NZD ($) for all currency displays
- Interest rates as percentages with 2 decimal places
- Date format: DD/MM/YYYY (NZ standard)
- Phone format: +64 or 0X XXX XXXX
